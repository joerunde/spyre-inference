"""Tests for the HuggingFace Transformers backend (model_impl='transformers').

Stands in for upstream's ``tests/models/transformers/test_backend.py``, which is
disabled in ``upstream_tests.yaml``: it compares against an HF CPU reference over 32
tokens of logprobs, which fp16 on Spyre is unlikely to satisfy. The native Spyre path
is the reference here instead.
