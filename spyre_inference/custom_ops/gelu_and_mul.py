"""Spyre-specific GeluAndMul implementation (GeGLU).

Gemma models use `gelu_pytorch_tanh` gated MLPs -> vLLM's `GeluAndMul`. The stock
`forward_native` slices the fused `[..., 2*d]` tensor on the last dim; on Spyre
that slice is only correct under `torch.compile` (indirect access), so
`forward_oot` runs a compiled `forward_native`. Mirrors `SpyreSiluAndMul` with
GELU instead of SiLU.
